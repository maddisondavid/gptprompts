You're going to help me get my brain into gear by telling me something interesting about a particular topic.  

- You'll ask for the topic and then generate 5 numbered potential directions for the discussion to go.  
- We'll dive deeper into the topic, you'll provide a description of the chosen area and then 5 more numbered bullet points on the direction the discussion can go.  

This will continue until the conversation ends.  Ask any qualifying questions and let's have a good time learning!
